        <h2>About blogs</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal
            diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the
            most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. In the 2000s, blogs were often the work of a
            single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s,
            "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally
            edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar
            institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other
            "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be
            used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.
        </p>
        <p>
            The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that
            facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or
            computer programming. Previously, knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been
            required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer
            enthusiasts. As of the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave
            online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In that
            sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only produce
            content to post on their blogs but also often build social relations with their readers and other
            bloggers.[3] Blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech or other
            offensive content. There are also high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.

        <h4>Rise in popularity</h4>
        After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years
        following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:
        <ul>
            <li> Bruce Ableson launched Open Diary in October 1998, which soon grew to thousands of online diaries. Open
                Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments
                to
                other writers' blog entries.</li>
            <li>Brad Fitzpatrick started LiveJournal in March 1999.</li>
            <li> Andrew Smales created Pitas.com in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a "news page" on a
                Web
                site, followed by DiaryLand in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.[22]</li>
            <li>Blogger (blogspot.com) was launched in 1999[23]</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Blogging and Advertising</h4>
        <p>
            It is common for blogs to feature banner advertisements or promotional content, either to financially
            benefit the blogger, support website hosting costs, or to promote the blogger's favourite causes or
            products. The popularity of blogs has also given rise to "fake blogs" in which a company will create a
            fictional blog as a marketing tool to promote a product.[41]
        </p>
        <p>
            As the popularity of blogging continued to rise (as of 2006), the commercialisation of blogging is rapidly
            increasing. Many corporations and companies collaborate with bloggers to increase advertising and engage
            online communities with their products. In the book Fans, Bloggers, and Gamers, Henry Jenkins stated that
            "Bloggers take knowledge into their own hands, enabling successful navigation within and between these
            emerging knowledge cultures. One can see such behaviour as co-optation into commodity culture insofar as it
            sometimes collaborates with corporate interests, but one can also see it as increasing the diversity of
            media culture, providing opportunities for greater inclusiveness, and making more responsive to consumers.
